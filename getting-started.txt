## 1. Basics

We've added the **Pancake.io** folder to your Dropbox Apps folder. If you don't see it yet, please wait a moment for it to sync to your computer. It will appear in **Dropbox > Apps > Pancake.io**

To create a web page, just add a file to the Pancake.io folder. Wait a couple of minutes for it to sync to Dropbox, and then refresh your dashboard to see it there. You'll be able to click on it and share the link with anyone. Updating the file will not change the link (unless you rename it).

We support a whole bunch of different file types: text files, images, pdfs, Microsoft Office files, and more.

**Advanced users**: If you want to personalize your public pages, you can upload a CSS file under [Settings](http://pancake.io/settings).

If you need any additional help, or have any feedback or suggestions, we'd love to hear from you! Send an email to support@pancake.io.

## 2. Page Configuration

At the top of this text file is configuration section that looks like this:

    ---
    title: Welcome to Pancake.io!
    header: Welcome
    ---

This section can be added to your Pancake.io text files to enable additional functionality.

## 3. Themes

We have a small but growing [collection of themes](http://themes.pancake.io) you can check out.

## 4. Formatting

You can format text using Markdown. Here are some of the more common things you might want to use:

- If you surround some text with double asterisks, you get **bold text**
- Single asterisks *emphasize text*
- You can make a list pretty easily too with dashes

For more see [here](http://pancake.io/help).
